# CProject

CProject generates a sample project with the [ctk](https://github.com/higgsbi/ctk) library.

Ordered arguments:
  1. Path to this directory 
  2. Name of the c project to generate

Example:
  `bash cproject/generate.sh cproject/ my_project_name`

I would recommend creating an alias for project generation like so:  
  `alias cproject='~/YOUR_PATH_HERE/generate.sh ~/YOUR_PATH_HERE/cproject/'`

This can alter be used simply:  
  `cproject my_project_name`
